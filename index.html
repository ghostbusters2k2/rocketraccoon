        <h2> About Rocket</h2>
    <p>     Rocket is a raccoon who was genetically modified by High Evolutionary, giving him enhanced intelligence and the ability to speak.
        Naming himself Rocket, he befriended fellow experiments Lylla, Teefs and Floor, with the four believing they would soon be allowed to live in peace on a new planet.
        Whilst aiding High Evolutionary in perfecting his experiments, Rocket discovered that he, along with his friends, were slated to be killed. 
        Rocket attempted to free his friends, only for the High Evolutionary to kill Lylla. Rocket then attacked his former master, mutilating him, which inadvertently resulted in the deaths of Teefs and Floor.
        Afterwards, Rocket boarded a ship and fled into the cosmos.</p>
        <p>     He later met Groot and later Guardians who went on many adventures from preventing Ronan from using the Power Stone to fighting Thanos.</p>
